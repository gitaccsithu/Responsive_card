### Details about the project

I used HTML and CSS for this project. I developed this project with the mobile-first workflow. I started working in mobile view, and then I changed the layout towards desktop view responsively. I used Flexbox for positioning most of the HTML elements. For readability, I designed my CSS selectors alphabetically for each section of the container.
